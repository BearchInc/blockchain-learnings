# Interesting Facts

- The Ethereum currency is named Ether or ETH for short.
- Seems like there is a possibility of Ethereum implement [Proof of Stake System](http://consensys.github.io/developers/articles/101-noob-intro/#parti) without miners. (

# Concepts

**Geth:** Go client for Ethereum
**Solidity:** Javascript based Ethereum language (compiles to EVM bytecode)
**Serpent:** Python based Ethereum language (compiles to EVM bytecode)
**LLL:** Lisp based Ethereum language (compiles to EVM bytecode)
**solc**: Solidity Language Compiler

# Development Tools

- [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle): npm package, basically Rails for Ethereum :). It provides generators for scaffolding and also provides tools (Mocha, Chai) allowing developers to perferm TDD while writing contracts.
- [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js): Ethereum Compatible Javascript API. It essentially allows web/mobile/desktop apps to read/write to the Ethereum network.
- [ether-pudding](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ether-pudding): Built on top of Web3.js, this framework provides a promise-oriented API for interacting with Ethereum network.
